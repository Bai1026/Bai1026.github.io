## Research Experience

### Speech Processing and Machine Learning Laboratory (SPMLLab), NTU

Undergraduate Researcher | **Advisor: Prof. Hung-yi Lee** | Taipei, Taiwan | Aug 2023 - Present

- Introduced BILLY, merging persona vectors of LLMs to enhance the creativity and replace discussion of multi-LLM systems.
- Boosting Originality by 15% and reducing the cost by 95% than multi-LLM baseline (Co-advised by Prof. Shao-Hua Sun).
- Contributed the Covid19CoughAudioClassification task to the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark by devising and preprocessing a novel dataset for evaluating universal speech models.

### Robot Learning Laboratory (RLLab), NTU

Undergraduate Researcher | **Advisor: Prof. Shao-Hua Sun** | Taipei, Taiwan | Nov 2023 - Oct 2024

- Developed a multi-agent discussion framework using role-play that boosted LLM creativity scores by 20% over existing methods.
- Designed an LLM creativity evaluation benchmark and metrics with 0.7 human-level correlation, validated on over 1,400 text generations.

### Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory (WMNLab), NTU

Undergraduate Researcher | **Advisor: Prof. Hung-Yu Wei** | Taipei, Taiwan | Feb 2022 - Nov 2023

- Utilized RNN, CatBoost, and XGBoost for the prediction and classification of mobile device handovers.
- Providing the core dataset for classification models of handovers through live UDP protocol experiments on the MRT.
