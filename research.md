## Research Experience

### [cite_start]Speech Processing and Machine Learning Laboratory (SPMLLab), NTU [cite: 35]

_Undergraduate Researcher | Advisor: Prof. Hung-yi Lee | Taipei, Taiwan | [cite_start]Aug 2023 - Present_ [cite: 36, 37]

- [cite_start]Introduced BILLY, merging persona vectors of LLMs to enhance the creativity and replace discussion of multi-LLM systems. [cite: 38]
- [cite_start]Boosting Originality by 15% and reducing the cost by 95% than multi-LLM baseline (Co-advised by Prof. Shao-Hua Sun). [cite: 39]
- [cite_start]Contributed the Covid19CoughAudioClassification task to the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark by devising and preprocessing a novel dataset for evaluating universal speech models. [cite: 40]

### [cite_start]Robot Learning Laboratory (RLLab), NTU [cite: 41]

_Undergraduate Researcher | Advisor: Prof. Shao-Hua Sun | Taipei, Taiwan | [cite_start]Nov 2023 - Oct 2024_ [cite: 42, 43, 44]

- [cite_start]Developed a multi-agent discussion framework using role-play that boosted LLM creativity scores by 20% over existing methods. [cite: 45]
- [cite_start]Designed an LLM creativity evaluation benchmark and metrics with 0.7 human-level correlation, validated on over 1,400 text generations. [cite: 47]

### [cite_start]Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory (WMNLab), NTU [cite: 48]

_Undergraduate Researcher | Advisor: Prof. Hung-Yu Wei | Taipei, Taiwan | [cite_start]Feb 2022 - Nov 2023_ [cite: 48, 49]

- [cite_start]Utilized RNN, CatBoost, and XGBoost for the prediction and classification of mobile device handovers. [cite: 50]
- [cite_start]Providing the core dataset for classification models of handovers through live UDP protocol experiments on the MRT. [cite: 51]
